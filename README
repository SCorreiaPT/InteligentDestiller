This is a project that uses a old analogic destiller machine, that machine got all old parts removed and got installed one 
ESP32 that controlls all its functions, it have also one web server built-in to controll all the machine. 
The machine have a water pump, a heater, a valve to control the water flow to cool the destiller coil
